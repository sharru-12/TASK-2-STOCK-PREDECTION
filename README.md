# TASK-2-STOCK-PREDECTION

Stock Prediction Project

Overview

This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning algorithms and technical indicators. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately forecast stock prices, enabling investors to make informed decisions.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the historical stock price data of [Company/Stock Ticker], obtained from [Data Source]. The dataset includes the following features:

- Date
- Open price
- High price
- Low price
- Close price
- Volume

Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers.
2. Feature Engineering: Technical indicators such as moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands are calculated to provide additional features for the model.
3. Model Selection: Several machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and LSTM networks, are evaluated to determine the best-performing model.
4. Hyperparameter Tuning: The hyperparameters of the selected model are optimized using grid search and cross-validation.
5. Model Evaluation: The performance of the final model is evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE).

Results

The best-performing model achieved a MAE of [Value] and an MSE of [Value]. The model's performance is visualized using plots of predicted vs. actual prices.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms in predicting stock prices. The results show that the selected model can accurately forecast stock prices, enabling investors to make informed decisions.

Code

The code for this project is written in Python and utilizes the following libraries:

- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

Future Work

1. Incorporate additional features: Include fundamental analysis features such as financial ratios and economic indicators to improve the model's performance.
2. Use more advanced models: Evaluate the performance of more complex models such as ensemble methods and deep learning architectures.
3. Expand to multiple stocks: Apply the model to multiple stocks to evaluate its performance across different companies and industries.
